# DeviousTest
A devious c# test to make fools of your colleagues and have some fun in interviews.

Some obscure c# functions along with some terrible code to confuse and befuddle the developer.

Originally thrown together to test an interview candidate but after challenging other developers it's caused a lot of head scratching fun.
